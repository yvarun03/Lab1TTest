# Lab1TTest

My Lab 1 Experience (Varun Yeduru): 12.1 Prerequisites: I confirmed completion of all prerequisite steps, including registration on GitHub, installation of R, RStudio, and Git, and successful push/pull verification.

12.2 Make a repo on GitHub: I created a new repository on GitHub, following the outlined steps for repository creation and copied the clone URL.

12.3 Clone the test GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio: I initiated a new RStudio Project using Version Control, pasted the GitHub repository URL, and successfully created the project.

This is line from R studio- Varun Yeduru

12.4 Make local changes, save, commit: I added a line to the README file in RStudio, saved it, and then clicked 'Commit' after typing a message in the commit box

12.5 Push your local changes online to GitHub: I clicked the "Push" button in RStudio to upload my changes to GitHub without any issues.

12.6 Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote: After refreshing the GitHub page, I verified that the changes I made in RStudio.
